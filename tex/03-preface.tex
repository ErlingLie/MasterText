This masterâ€™s thesis is submitted as a part of the requirements for the master's
degree at the Department of Engineering Cybernetics at the Norwegian University
of Science and Technology. The work presented in this thesis has been carried out under the supervision of
Prof. Kristin Y. Pettersen and Ph.D. candidate Josef Matou\v{s} at the Department of Engineering Cybernetics, NTNU.


During the project, I have been provided Simulink models for the 6-DOF hand-position controller and the first-order NSB method by Josef Matou\v{s}. The Simulink models as well as the included MATLAB code served as a foundation for the Matlab simulator used in Chapter~\ref{cha:sim_matlab}. The simulator was modified and extended to combine both the centralized and decentralized NSB methods with the hand-position controller.

Unless otherwise stated, all figures and illustrations have been created by the author, however, the SVG object for the yellow AUVs found in several of the figures was provided by Josef Matou\v{s}.

I would like to thank my supervisors Kristin Y. Pettersen and Josef Matou\v{s} for providing advice throughout my thesis. Their expertise and feedback have been instrumental in shaping the direction and quality of this work. I would also like to extend my appreciation to my friends for their support, and encouragement, and for being a source of motivation throughout my academic journey. Their presence and willingness to listen have made the last five years of university truly enjoyable.\\[.5cm]
