	abstract = {This paper treats the subject of fundamental guidance principles related to motion behaviour in a 2D plane and a 3D space. In this context, the concept of guidance-based path following is defined and elaborated upon. Its specifies are contrasted towards the already established concept of trajectory tracking. Specifically, guidance laws are developed at an ideal, dynamics-independent level to yield generally valid laws uninfluenced by the particularities of any specific dynamics case. These laws can subsequently be tailored to actual target systems like e.g. watercraft or spacecraft, for instance in a cascaded setting. The approach renders all regular paths feasible. Possible applications and extensions to the guidance-based path following scheme are also briefly suggested.},

	doi = {10.1109/CDC.2012.6427007},
	abstract = {A control strategy allowing underactuated underwater vehicles to accomplish 3D straight line path following tasks in the presence of ocean currents is developed. The ocean current is considered constant, irrotational and acting in any direction of the inertial frame. The control technique is based on a modified three-dimensional Line-of-Sight (LOS) guidance law with two integrators and three feedback controllers. The integral effect is introduced to successfully counteract the drifting caused by the unknown current. The integration laws are chosen to reduce the risk of wind-up effects. Furthermore, due to the irrotational nature of the ocean current, it is seen that the vehicle dynamics can be defined in terms of relative velocities only. This significantly simplifies the control system compared to approaches based on absolute velocities, and as a result no adaption laws are required. Uniform global asymptotic stability and uniform local exponential stability for the closed loop system are proven and explicit bounds on the guidance law parameters are given.},

The proposed dynamic update law of the path variable is nonsingular and the guidance law is designed such that the vessel can reject constant unknown ocean currents by using an ocean current observer. It is shown that the closed-loop system composed of the guidance law, controller and observer provides globally asymptotically stable and locally exponentially stable path following errors. The sway velocity dynamics is analyzed and, under adequate conditions on the path curvature, it is shown that the dynamics is well behaved and the guidance law is well-defined. Simulations are presented to verify the theoretical findings.},

By ensuring boundedness of the Barrier Lyapunov Function in the closed loop, we ensure that those limits are not transgressed. Besides the nominal case where full knowledge of the plant is available, we also tackle scenarios wherein parametric uncertainties are present. Asymptotic tracking is achieved without violation of the constraint, and all closed loop signals remain bounded, under a mild condition on the initial output. Furthermore, we explore the use of an Asymmetric Barrier Lyapunov Function as a generalized approach that relaxes the requirements on the initial conditions. We also compare our control with one that is based on a Quadratic Lyapunov Function, and we show that our control requires less restrictive initial conditions. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed control.},

	abstract = {This work addresses the task of designing the optimal survey route that an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) should take in mine countermeasures (MCM) operations. It is assumed that the AUV is equipped with a side-looking sonar that is capable of generating high-resolution imagery of the underwater environment. The objective of the path-planning task is framed in terms of maximizing the success of detecting underwater mines in such imagery. Several commonly made - but inaccurate - assumptions about the problem are raised and refuted; it is demonstrated that mine detection performance depends on both range and seabed type. The issue of how to update detection probabilities when multiple views are obtained is also addressed. These various considerations are exploited in conjunction with synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) data to predict detection performance and efficiently design AUV routes that outperform standard ladder surveys. The proposed algorithm can be used to assess and quantify detection performance achieved in past, as well as future, missions. Because the entire route of the AUV can still be designed before deployment, no additional onboard processing or adaptive capabilities are required of the AUV. Therefore, the proposed approach can be immediately applied to systems conducting MCM operations at sea. The method is demonstrated on real SAS imagery collected by an AUV in the Baltic Sea.},

Studies of sea-ice underwater morphology are limited largely to scientific utilization of submarines. Remotely operated vehicles, tethered to a mother ship by umbilical cable, have been deployed to investigate tidewater-glacier and ice-shelf margins, but their range is often restricted. The development of free-flying autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with ranges of tens to hundreds of kilometres enables extensive missions to take place beneath sea ice and floating ice shelves. Autosub2 is a 3600 kg, 6.7 m long AUV, with a 1600 m operating depth and range of 400 km, based on the earlier Autosub1 which had a 500 m depth limit. A single direct-drive d.c. motor and five-bladed propeller produce speeds of 1–2 m s−1. Rear-mounted rudder and stern-plane control yaw, pitch and depth. The vehicle has three sections. The front and rear sections are free-flooding, built around aluminium extrusion space-frames covered with glass-fibre reinforced plastic panels. The central section has a set of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic pressure vessels. Four tubes contain batteries powering the vehicle. The other three house vehicle-control systems and sensors. The rear section houses subsystems for navigation, control actuation and propulsion and scientific sensors (e.g. digital camera, upward-looking 300 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler, 200 kHz multibeam receiver). The front section contains forward-looking collision sensor, emergency abort, the homing systems, Argos satellite data and location transmitters and flashing lights for relocation as well as science sensors (e.g. twin conductivity–temperature–depth instruments, multibeam transmitter, sub-bottom profiler, AquaLab water sampler). Payload restrictions mean that a subset of scientific instruments is actually in place on any given dive. The scientific instruments carried on Autosub are described and examples of observational data collected from each sensor in Arctic or Antarctic waters are given (e.g. of roughness at the underside of floating ice shelves and sea ice).},

Their ability to operate autonomously of a host vessel makes them well suited to exploration of extreme environments, from the world's deepest hydrothermal vents to beneath polar ice sheets. They have revolutionised our ability to image the seafloor, providing higher resolution seafloor mapping data than can be achieved from surface vessels, particularly in deep water. This contribution focuses on the major advances in marine geoscience that have resulted from AUV data. The primary applications are i) submarine volcanism and hydrothermal vent studies, ii) mapping and monitoring of low-temperature fluid escape features and chemosynthetic ecosystems, iii) benthic habitat mapping in shallow- and deep-water environments, and iv) mapping of seafloor morphological features (e.g. bedforms generated beneath ice or sediment-gravity flows). A series of new datasets is presented that highlight the growing versatility of AUVs for marine geoscience studies, including i) multi-frequency acoustic imaging of trawling impacts on deep-water coral mounds, iii) collection of high-resolution seafloor photomosaics at abyssal depths, and iii) velocity measurements of active submarine density flows. Future developments in AUV technology of potential relevance to marine geoscience include new vehicles with enhanced hovering, long endurance, extreme depth, or rapid response capabilities, while development of new sensors will further expand the range of geochemical parameters that can be measured.},

	abstract = {This dissertation presents an extensive analysis of the integral line-of-sight (ILOS) guidance method for path following tasks of underactuated marine vessels and vehicles, operating on and below the sea surface. It is shown that thanks to the embedded integral action, the guidance law makes the vessels follow straight lines in presence of environmental disturbances such as currents, wind and waves. The analysis develops linearly with a growth of complexity that spans from simple two and three dimensional (2-3D) kinematic models to full kinematic-dynamic models for surface and underwater vehicles including environmental disturbances of different nature. Furthermore, the problem of steering a vehicle against the ocean current or with the ocean current is addressed as well.

The ILOS guidance is first applied to a simple kinematic model of surface vessels that neglects the vehicle dynamics. It is shown, using simple and intuitive mathematical tools, that current compensation for underactuated surface vessels reduces to a pure vectorial sum and has one possible solution that identifies the only heading the ship can hold to compensate for the drift. The relative velocity of the vessel is kept constant and compensation is achieved through side-slipping. It is proved that path following of straight lines is obtained. A discussion involving intuitive as well as practical aspects of the ILOS law is also given. A 3D version of the same ILOS is then applied to a kinematic model of underactuated underwater vehicles, thus extending the same concepts and the same analysis to 3D.

The following step in complexity consists of including the underactuated dynamics into the Lyapunov analysis of the 2D ILOS guidance law. Disturbances in the form of constant irrotational ocean currents and constant dynamic, attitude dependent, forces are taken into account. The mathematical complexity of the analysis increases significantly compared to the pure kinematic cases, yielding explicit bounds on the guidance law gains to guarantee stability.

Next, the complete kinematic and dynamic closed loop system of the ILOS guidance law for path following purposes of underactuated surface vessels is analyzed. The actuated surge and yaw dynamics are included in the analysis and it is shown that the resulting closed loop system forms a cascade. The properties of uniform global asymptotic stability (UGAS) and uniform local exponential stability (ULES) are shown for the closed loop cascaded system. In this case disturbances in the form of irrotational ocean currents are considered only. Results from simulations and experiments are presented to support and illustrate the theoretical results where the ILOS guidance is applied to the CART vehicle for sea trials.

The possibility of extending the ILOS guidance law proposed for underactuated surface marine vehicles to fully actuated marine vehicles with saturated transverse actuators is analyzed as well. Low-speed path following of straight lines is considered and the proposed solution is inspired by practical issues faced when operating remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) at sea. As a result, a solution combining the ILOS guidance law with a nonlinear bounded sway feedback controller is designed. UGAS and ULES for the origin of the closed loop system are proved and the theoretical results are supported by simulations.

It is furthermore shown that the ILOS guidance law successfully compensates for combined kinematic and dynamic disturbances, thus further extending the previous results. To this end, a 3 degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) maneuvering model for control design purposes that includes both the kinematic and dynamic disturbing effects of currents, wind and waves is presented. The ILOS guidance method is extended with adaptation and it is analytically shown that the resulting control scheme successfully compensates for both kinds of disturbances and hence guarantees path following of underactuated surface vessels in different sea conditions with UGAS and ULES stability properties. The theoretical results are supported by simulations.

The complete kinematic and dynamic closed loop system of the 3D ILOS guidance law is analyzed as well, hence extending the developed analysis to underactuated AUVs for 3D straight-line path following applications in the presence of constant irrotational ocean currents. The closed loop stability analysis concludes UGAS and ULES and gives explicit conditions on the guidance law parameters. The proposed 3D ILOS guidance control scheme is applied to the LAUV autonomous underwater vehicle and results from simulations and sea trials are shown to support the theoretical findings.

This dissertation addresses the problem of steering a marine vessel against the ocean current or with the ocean current as well and hence two guidance laws for counter-current and co-current guidance of underactuated marine vehicles in 3-DOFs are presented. The guidance laws are based on the relation between the relative and absolute velocities and show different stability properties: local exponential stability (LES) for the first and uniform semiglobal exponential stability (USES) for the second. In both the cases the closed loop system reveals multiple stable/unstable equilibrium points, corresponding to the counter-current/co-current directions depending on the setting. Simulation results support the theoretical findings},

	abstract = {In the previous chapter, direct and inverse kinematics equations establishing the relationship between the joint variables and the end-effector pose were derived. In this chapter, differential kinematics is presented which gives the relationship between the joint velocities and the corresponding end-effector linear and angular velocity. This mapping is described by a matrix, termed geometric Jacobian, which depends on the manipulator configuration. Alternatively, if the end-effector pose is expressed with reference to a minimal representation in the operational space, it is possible to compute the Jacobian matrix via differentiation of the direct kinematics function with respect to the joint variables. The resulting Jacobian, termed analytical Jacobian, in general differs from the geometric one. The Jacobian constitutes one of the most important tools for manipulator characterization; in fact, it is useful for finding singularities, analyzing redundancy, determining inverse kinematics algorithms, describing the mapping between forces applied to the end-effector and resulting torques at the joints (statics) and, as will be seen in the following chapters, deriving dynamic equations of motion and designing operational space control schemes. Finally, the kineto-statics duality concept is illustrated, which is at the basis of the definition of velocity and force manipulability ellipsoids.},

The former guarantees that the FRP, and thus the formation, tracks the path, while the latter ensures accurate speed control along the path. A dynamic guidance system with feedback from the states of all ships ensures that all ships have the same priority (no leader) when moving along the path.

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of steering a group of underactuated autonomous vehicles along given spatial paths, while holding a desired inter-vehicle formation pattern. For a general class of vehicles moving in either two or three-dimensional space, we show how Lyapunov-based techniques and graph theory can be brought together to yield a decentralized control structure where the dynamics of the cooperating vehicles and the constraints imposed by the topology of the inter-vehicle communications network are explicitly taken into account. Path-following for each vehicle amounts to reducing an appropriately defined geometric error to a small neighborhood of the origin. Vehicle coordination is achieved by adjusting the speed of each vehicle along its path according to information on the positions of a subset of the other vehicles, as determined by the communications topology adopted. The system obtained by putting together the path-following and vehicle coordination strategies adopted takes a cascade form, where the former subsystem is input-to-state stable (ISS) with the error variables of the latter as inputs. Convergence and stability of the overall system are proved formally. The results are also extended to solve the problem of temporary communication failures. Using the concept of "brief instabilities" we show that for a given maximum failure rate, the coordinated path following system is stable and the errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. We illustrate our design procedure for underwater vehicles moving in three-dimensional space. Simulations results are presented and discussed},

A formation controller, consisting of a feedback linearization part and a sliding mode compensator, is designed to stabilize the overall system. The proposed controller generates the commanded torques for the follower robot and makes the formation control system robust to the effect of unknown bounded disturbances in dynamic modeling. Furthermore, on active obstacle avoidance is presented by considering the obstacle as a virtual leader in our proposed model.

In the proposed leader–follower control, the follower tracks a reference trajectory based on the leader position and predetermined formation without the need for leader's velocity and dynamics. This is desirable in marine robotics due to weak underwater communication and low bandwidth. A virtual vehicle is constructed such that its trajectory converges to the reference trajectory of the follower. Position tracking control is designed for the follower to track the virtual vehicle using Lyapunov and backstepping synthesis. Approximation-based control technique is employed to handle the model parametric uncertainties and unknown disturbances for the follower. The residual error between vehicles within the formation is proven to converge to a bounded compact set and control performance is guaranteed by suitably choosing the design parameters. Extensive simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches presented.},

	abstract = {A control strategy for path following of linear paths for under-actuated autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is presented. We consider the case in which an unknown ocean current is affecting the system. We adopt a Luenberger observer to estimate the current. The desired orientation of the vehicles is assigned using a rotation matrix, and this is defined using the estimated vector of the ocean current and a vector containing the cross track error. Since the desired orientation is given in the form of a rotation matrix, an attitude error function defined on the SO(2) group is used in order to define an orientation error. The desired surge velocity is defined based on the ocean current estimate in order to counteract the current and keep a desired along-path velocity (speed over ground). Based on a mathematical model describing both the kinematics and dynamics of the vehicles, and using cascaded systems theory, almost semi-global asymptotic stability (almost-SGAS) is proven. Simulation results are included that validate the theoretical result.},

The controller is first derived at the kinematic level assuming that the ocean current disturbance is known.

	abstract = {The popularity of Bayesian optimization methods for efficient exploration of parameter spaces has lead to a series of papers applying Gaussian processes as surrogates in the optimization of functions. However, most proposed approaches only allow the exploration of the parameter space to occur sequentially. Often, it is desirable to simultaneously propose batches of parameter values to explore. This is particularly the case when large parallel processing facilities are available. These facilities could be computational or physical facets of the process being optimized. E.g. in biological experiments many experimental set ups allow several samples to be simultaneously processed. Batch methods, however, require modeling of the interaction between the evaluations in the batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios. We investigate a simple heuristic based on an estimate of the Lipschitz constant that captures the most important aspect of this interaction (i.e. local repulsion) at negligible computational overhead. The resulting algorithm compares well, in running time, with much more elaborate alternatives. The approach assumes that the function of interest, \$f\$, is a Lipschitz continuous function. A wrap-loop around the acquisition function is used to collect batches of points of certain size minimizing the non-parallelizable computational effort. The speed-up of our method with respect to previous approaches is significant in a set of computationally expensive experiments.},

	abstract = {Bayesian Optimization aims at optimizing an unknown non-convex/concave function that is costly to evaluate. We are interested in application scenarios where concurrent function evaluations are possible. Under such a setting, BO could choose to either sequentially evaluate the function, one input at a time and wait for the output of the function before making the next selection, or evaluate the function at a batch of multiple inputs at once. These two different settings are commonly referred to as the sequential and batch settings of Bayesian Optimization. In general, the sequential setting leads to better optimization performance as each function evaluation is selected with more information, whereas the batch setting has an advantage in terms of the total experimental time (the number of iterations). In this work, our goal is to combine the strength of both settings. Specifically, we systematically analyze Bayesian optimization using Gaussian process as the posterior estimator and provide a hybrid algorithm that, based on the current state, dynamically switches between a sequential policy and a batch policy with variable batch sizes. We provide theoretical justification for our algorithm and present experimental results on eight benchmark BO problems. The results show that our method achieves substantial speedup (up to \%78) compared to a pure sequential policy, without suffering any significant performance loss.},

	doi = {10.1109/SFCS.2005.9},
	abstract = {Given an arc-weighted directed graph G = (V, A, /spl lscr/) and a pair of nodes s, t, we seek to find an s-t walk of length at most B that maximizes some given function f of the set of nodes visited by the walk. The simplest case is when we seek to maximize the number of nodes visited: this is called the orienteering problem. Our main result is a quasi-polynomial time algorithm that yields an O(log OPT) approximation for this problem when f is a given submodular set function. We then extend it to the case when a node v is counted as visited only if the walk reaches v in its time window [R(v), D(v)]. We apply the algorithm to obtain several new results. First, we obtain an O(log OPT) approximation for a generalization of the orienteering problem in which the profit for visiting each node may vary arbitrarily with time. This captures the time window problem considered earlier for which, even in undirected graphs, the best approximation ratio known [Bansal, N et al. (2004)] is O(log/sup 2/ OPT). The second application is an O(log/sup 2/ k) approximation for the k-TSP problem in directed graphs (satisfying asymmetric triangle inequality). This is the first non-trivial approximation algorithm for this problem. The third application is an O(log/sup 2/ k) approximation (in quasi-poly time) for the group Steiner problem in undirected graphs where k is the number of groups. This improves earlier ratios (Garg, N et al.) by a logarithmic factor and almost matches the inapproximability threshold on trees (Halperin and Krauthgamer, 2003). This connection to group Steiner trees also enables us to prove that the problem we consider is hard to approximate to a ratio better than /spl Omega/(log/sup 1-/spl epsi// OPT), even in undirected graphs. Even though our algorithm runs in quasi-poly time, we believe that the implications for the approximability of several basic optimization problems are interesting.},

	abstract = {Recent research in robot exploration and mapping has focused on sampling environmental hotspot fields. This exploration task is formalized by Low, Dolan, and Khosla (2008) in a sequential decision-theoretic planning under uncertainty framework called MASP. The time complexity of solving MASP approximately depends on the map resolution, which limits its use in large-scale, high-resolution exploration and mapping. To alleviate this computational difficulty, this paper presents an information-theoretic approach to MASP (iMASP) for efficient adaptive path planning; by reformulating the cost-minimizing iMASP as a reward-maximizing problem, its time complexity becomes independent of map resolution and is less sensitive to increasing robot team size as demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. Using the reward-maximizing dual, we derive a novel adaptive variant of maximum entropy sampling, thus improving the induced exploration policy performance. It also allows us to establish theoretical bounds quantifying the performance advantage of optimal adaptive over non-adaptive policies and the performance quality of approximately optimal vs. optimal adaptive policies. We show analytically and empirically the superior performance of iMASP-based policies for sampling the log-Gaussian process to that of policies for the widely-used Gaussian process in mapping the hotspot field. Lastly, we provide sufficient conditions that, when met, guarantee adaptivity has no benefit under an assumed environment model.},

Thus, careful coordination of their paths is required in order to maximize the amount of information collected, while respecting the resource constraints. In this paper, we present an efficient approach for near-optimally solving the NP-hard optimization problem of planning such informative paths. In particular, we first develop eSIP (efficient Single-robot Informative Path planning), an approximation algorithm for optimizing the path of a single robot. Hereby, we use a Gaussian Process to model the underlying phenomenon, and use the mutual information between the visited locations and remainder of the space to quantify the amount of information collected. We prove that the mutual information collected using paths obtained by using eSIP is close to the information obtained by an optimal solution. We then provide a general technique, sequential allocation, which can be used to extend any single robot planning algorithm, such as eSIP, for the multi-robot problem. This procedure approximately generalizes any guarantees for the single-robot problem to the multi-robot case. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on several experiments performed in-field for two important environmental sensing applications, lake and river monitoring, and simulation experiments performed using several real world sensor network data sets.},

	abstract = {The need for efficient monitoring of spatio-temporal dynamics in large environmental surveillance applications motivates the use of robotic sensors to achieve sufficient spatial and temporal coverage. A common approach in machine learning to model spatial dynamics is to use the nonparametric Bayesian framework known as Gaussian Processes (GPs) (c.f., [1]) which are fully specified by a mean and a covariance function. However, defining suitable covariance functions that are able to appropriately model complex space-time dependencies in the environment is a challenging task. In this paper, we develop a generic approach for constructing several classes of covariance functions for spatio-temporal GP modeling. The GP models are then extended to perform efficient path planning in continuous space while maximizing the information gain. Extensive empirical evaluation for the different classes of covariance functions using real world sensing datasets is discussed, including experiments on a tethered robotic system - Networked Info Mechanical System (NIMS).},

We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze an intuitive Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal in- formation gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches.},

Though seemingly modest, this exercise has inspired studies by mathematicians, chemists, and physicists. Teachers use it in the classroom. It has practical applications in genetics, telecommunications, and neuroscience. The authors of this book are the same pioneers who for nearly two decades have led the investigation into the traveling salesman problem. They have derived solutions to almost eighty-six thousand cities, yet a general solution to the problem has yet to be discovered. Here they describe the method and computer code they used to solve a broad range of large-scale problems, and along the way they demonstrate the interplay of applied mathematics with increasingly powerful computing platforms.

	abstract = {Robotic sampling is attractive in many field robotics applications that require persistent collection of physical samples for ex-situ analysis. Examples abound in the earth sciences in studies involving the collection of rock, soil, and water samples for laboratory analysis. In our test domain, marine ecosystem monitoring, detailed understanding of plankton ecology requires laboratory analysis of water samples, but predictions using physical and chemical properties measured in real-time by sensors aboard an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) can guide sample collection decisions. In this paper, we present a data-driven and opportunistic sampling strategy to minimize cumulative regret for batches of plankton samples acquired by an AUV over multiple surveys. Samples are labeled at the end of each survey, and used to update a probabilistic model that guides sampling during subsequent surveys. During a survey, the AUV makes irrevocable sample collection decisions online for a sequential stream of candidates, with no knowledge of the quality of future samples. In addition to extensive simulations using historical field data, we present results from a one-day field trial where beginning with a prior model learned from data collected and labeled in an earlier campaign, the AUV collected water samples with a high abundance of a pre-specified planktonic target. This is the first time such a field experiment has been carried out in its entirety in a data-driven fashion, in effect ?closing the loop? on a significant and relevant ecosystem monitoring problem while allowing domain experts (marine ecologists) to specify the mission at a relatively high level.},

The static nodes are able to take sensor readings continuously in place, while the mobile robot is able to move and sample at multiple locations. The measurements from the robot and the static nodes are used to reconstruct an underlying scalar field. The algorithm presented in this paper accepts the measurements made by the static nodes as inputs and computes a path for the mobile robot which minimizes the integrated mean square error of the reconstructed field subject to the constraint that the robot has limited energy. We assume that the field does not change when robot is taking samples. In addition to simulations, we have validated the algorithm on a robotic boat and a system of static buoys operating in a lake over several km of traversed distance while reconstructing the temperature field of the lake surface},

	abstract = {When monitoring spatial phenomena, which can often be modeled as Gaussian processes (GPs), choosing sensor locations is a fundamental task. There are several common strategies to address this task, for example, geometry or disk models, placing sensors at the points of highest entropy (variance) in the GP model, and A-, D-, or E-optimal design. In this paper, we tackle the combinatorial optimization problem of maximizing the mutual information between the chosen locations and the locations which are not selected. We prove that the problem of ﬁnding the conﬁguration that maximizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1 − 1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of mutual information. We also show how submodularity can be used to obtain online bounds, and design branch and bound search procedures. We then extend our algorithm to exploit lazy evaluations and local structure in the GP, yielding signiﬁcant speedups. We also extend our approach to ﬁnd placements which are robust against node failures and uncertainties in the model. These extensions are again associated with rigorous theoretical approximation guarantees, exploiting the submodularity of the objective function. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach towards optimizing mutual information in a very extensive empirical study on two real-world data sets.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.hal.2006.03.005},
	abstract = {Blooms of toxic algae are increasing in magnitude and frequency around the globe, causing extensive economic and environmental impacts. On the west coast of Florida, blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis (Davis) have been documented annually for the last 30 years causing respiratory irritation in humans, fish kills, and toxin bioaccumulation in shellfish beds. As a result, methods need to be established to monitor and predict bloom formation and transport to mitigate their harmful effects on the surrounding ecosystems and local communities. In the past, monitoring and mitigation efforts have relied on visual confirmation of water discoloration, fish kills, and laborious cell counts, but recently satellite remote sensing has been used to track harmful algal blooms (HABs) along the Florida coast. Unfortunately satellite ocean color is limited by cloud cover, lack of detection below one optical depth, and revisit frequency, all of which can lead to extended periods without data. To address these shortcomings, an optical phytoplankton discriminator (OPD) was developed to detect K. brevis cells in mixed phytoplankton assemblages. The OPD was integrated into autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) platforms to gather spatially and temporally relevant data that can be used in collaboration with satellite imagery to provide a 3D picture of bloom dynamics over time. In January 2005, a Remote Environmental Monitoring UnitS (REMUS) AUV with an OPD payload was deployed on the west coast of Florida to retrieve a similarity index (SI), which indicates when K. brevis dominates the phytoplankton community. SI was used to monitor a K. brevis bloom in relation to temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and ocean currents. Current speed, SI, temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll a from the AUV were used to quantify a 1 km displacement of the K. brevis bloom front that was observed over the deployment period. The ability to monitor short term bloom movement will improve monitoring and predictive efforts that are used to provide warnings for local tourism and fishing industries. In addition, understanding the fine scale environmental conditions associated with bloom formation will increase our ability to predict the location and timing of K. brevis bloom formation. This study demonstrates the use of one autonomous platform and provides evidence that a nested array of AUVs and moorings equipped with new sensors, combined with remote sensing, can provide an early warning and monitoring system to reduce the impact of HABs.},

Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV's) are deployed for detection and cleaning of oil spills. As the coastal areas are vast and lengthy, effective path planning of deployed AUVs is necessary. Many path planning algorithms for AUVs have been proposed in literature using approaches which necessitate search through large distance. The AUVs have to travel through a large distance to detect the spills in the search area resulting in more energy consumption. In this article we propose an efficient approach for determination of optimal AUV paths for detection of oil spills resulting in reduced search distance for a given area. The proposed approach implements a hybrid evolutionary optimization algorithm named Whale Cuckoo Search Optimization Algorithm (WCSOA) that results in increase in the search space, global search ability and the convergence speed. With the proposed approach the overall search delay and energy consumption of AUVs are reduced. It is observed from the simulation results obtained that the proposed approach provides reduction in AUV energy consumption by 57\% compared to the existing Boustrophedon and WOA approach.},

The measure is used to compare some pairs of experiments without reference to prior distributions; this method of comparison is contrasted with the methods discussed by Blackwell. Finally, the measure is applied to provide a solution to some problems of experimental design, where the object of experimentation is not to reach decisions but rather to gain knowledge about the world.},

	abstract = {New robotic sensor platforms have computing resources that enable a rich set of tasks for adaptive monitoring of the environment. But to substantially augment the toolbox of environmental sensing, such platforms must be embedded with realistic statistical models and coherent methodologies for designing experiments and assimilating the data. In this article, we develop myopic and hybrid strategies for autonomous underwater vehicle sampling in space and time. These strategies are based on a stochastic advection-diffusion Gaussian process model for the mine tailings concentration in a Norwegian fjord, and the goal is to monitor the excursion set (ES) of high concentrations. Closed form expressions for the expected misclassification probabilities of the ES enable real-time operation on board the autonomous vehicle, and this is used to guide the spatio-temporal sampling. Simulation studies show that the suggested strategies outperform other approaches that either (i) simplify the models for spatio-temporal variation, or (ii) simplify the design criterion. A field test shows how autonomous underwater sampling is useful for refining an initial stochastic advection-diffusion model. These experiments further show that the vehicle can adapt to focus on regions with intermediate concentrations where it is natural to improve the ES prediction.},

The research is aiming to improve real-time monitoring of dispersal dynamics connected to marine industries such as oil and mine tailing. By exploiting in-situ information from sensors, the AUV is able to assimilate and adapt the mission capitalizing on all the information available. The spatial model is built using Gaussian process approximations and an objective function for path planning is suggested to maximize the value of the collected information.},
